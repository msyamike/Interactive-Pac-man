# Interactive-Pac-man
In this Project we have developed a Pac-Man Calorie Counter prototype which serve as a great starting point that will influence people to eat healthy, where they are enabled to choose a healthy, junk, or mixed mode, choose what to eat and what not to eat.
(i.e. healthy food items vs. junk food items)within the respective mode, choose to ’pick up’ items (i.e.height blocks and danger blocks) within the respective mode,and monitor calories, lives and score at the end.
